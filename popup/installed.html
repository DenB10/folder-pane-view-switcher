      <p> This add-on adds arrow buttons at the top of the folder pane which rotate back and forth through the various
        available folder views.</p>

      <p> This add-on also causes Thunderbird to automatically switch to the "All Folders" view when you hover over the
        title above the folder tree
        for several seconds during a message drag & drop operation, and switch back automatically after the drop. In the
        add-on preferences,
        you can set the delay before the view is switched. </p>

      <p> Finally, in the add-on preferences, you can select which views are accessible in the pop-up menu at the top of
        the
        folder list, and of those, which show up when you rotate through the views using the arrow buttons. </p>

        In TB 78/91, Thunderbird internals changed widely. Klaus Buecher/opto
        is making {addon} fully
        functional again and will add additional features for the new multi-view mode. I appreciate if you can support
        this work by a donation. </p>
